This approach will use RabbitMQ.

Pros:
    Server is completely portable and independent of clients.
    Clients only reqire a somewhat small wrapper api.
    Build around publish/subscribe model.

Cons:
    A tad bit of setup is required for the server.  Not really much of a con.
    Not sure about the performance capabilities.
    Need a separate "bolt on" script if you want to do any server side processing of data.
        Would need separate in/out topics.
        Probably would lead to a good deal of overhead.
	Only works with Python2.X
	Not exactly thread safe.  Should be ok with one connection per thread.

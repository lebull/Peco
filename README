So I need to be able to get sound from my pc to my mac.  And from my mac to my pc.
Also, this would be awesome if it could be slapped on a Raspberry Pi and play sound throughout my apartment.  Or the same setup could be expanded to control lights or whatever.  But that's pipedreaming...

Still, the idea is to get messages from point-A to point-B through a subscription-like service.

--Process Goal--

Client-A creates service A.
Client-A publishes to service A.
Client-A requests service B.

Client-B creates service B.
Client-B publishes service B.
Client-B requests service A.

Client-A consumes service B.
Client-B consumes service A.
